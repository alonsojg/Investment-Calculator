Now, the whole point of this interactive graph is to better inform anyone who has 401(k) of the potential of their contributions (or lack there of) via a direct comparison with independent investing (or again, lack there of). With saving accounts' all-time-low interests returns the next best option for most is contributing to a 401(k) retirement fund for a future financial parachute. But if you are contemplating investing on your own there are a few things you must take into account. For example, if your company offers a percentage match you are practically being given free money to invest. So why not take advantage of it? This would probably be the optimal course of action for most who rather not worry themselves with the unpredictable movement of company stocks. At least with this tool you can get a better grasp of what your future retirement fund will hold for you once you hit that sweet 59.5 years of age. Please make sure to comment and give feedback for the improvement of this tool. Enjoy!
